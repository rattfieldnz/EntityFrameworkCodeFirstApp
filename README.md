=======
EntityFrameworkCodeFirstApp
===========================

This is a new repository replacing an old one (which was at https://github.com/rattfieldnz/Databases_EntityFrameworkApp_C-). The app is made for a fictitious organisation called Saturday Morning Music Classes - which conducts instrument and vocal lessons for students and community orchestra members. The app is being coded in Visual C# with Entity Framework and Code First. The Old repository was deleted as it contained database-specific information that shouldn't have been there.
